Before you can shape wood to your will, you must embrace the primal path. Begin your journey with flint — sharp, unyielding — the first tool of those who crawl from darkness into dawn.

Start by breaking leaves to collect sticks. Look for flint on the ground or by breaking gravel.

Gather some rocks, then craft a crafting rock. Place the sticks and flint on it, and strike them a few times with another rock using <keybind;key.use>.
