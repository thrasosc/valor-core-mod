Start by breaking leaves to collect %{item.minecraft.stick}%s. Look for %{item.minecraft.flint}% on the ground or by breaking gravel. Gather some %{item.earlystage.rock}%s, then craft a %{item.earlystage.crafting_rock}%. Place the sticks and flint on it, and strike them a few times with another rock using <keybind;key.use>.
